Find the minimum sum of Products of two arrays of the same size, given that k modifications are allowed on the first array. In each modification, one array element of the first array can either be increased or decreased by 2.
Examples: 

Input : a[] = {1, 2, -3}
        b[]  = {-2, 3, -5}
           k = 5
Output : -31
Explanation:
Here n = 3 and k = 5. 
So, we modified a[2], which is -3 and 
increased it by 10 (as 5 modifications 
are allowed).
Final sum will be :
(1 * -2) + (2 * 3) + (7 * -5)
   -2    +    6    -    35
             -31
(which is the minimum sum of the array 
with given conditions)
