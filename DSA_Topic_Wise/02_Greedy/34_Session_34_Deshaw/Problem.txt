Understanding :-> We are given an array of size “N”; we want to change the minimum number of elements in the array such that the final array is permutation of numbers from 1 to N; what will be the minimum number operations. 

Algorithm to find minimum number of operations:-> 
Travel the array ; you have to change all the numbers which are > n and also remove the numbers which are <=n but having duplicates.
